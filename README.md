Genetic Algorithms are a family of computational models inspired by evolution. These algorithms encode a potential solution to a specific problem on a simple chromosome-like data structure and apply recombination operators to these structures as as to preserve critical information. Genetic algorithms are often viewed as function optimizer, although the range of problems to which genetic algorithms have been applied are quite broad.

The genetic algorithm starts with a population, in which  there are random chromosomes on each individual.  Then, the individuals are evaluated and the fitness is calculated. Depending on the value of the fitness, the individual will be more or less adapted for the target problem. Those that have higher fitness will be better adapted and so on they will have more probabilities to reproduce themselves. 

The procedure in which the best individuals have more chances to reproduce is called natural selection. Therefore, after a long period of time, the entire population will consist of lots of genes from the superior individuals and less from the inferior individuals.


The genetic algorithm has been an active research area in the last decades and has shown its effectiveness in a wide range of combinatorial optimization and design problems. It has been used in many different areas: numerical optimitzation, cirquit design, automatic programming, machine and robot learning, economic models, ecological models… It provides fast solutions to high-dimensional problems. Genetic algorithms are used when: 
-	The search space is large, complex or poorly understood
-	Domain knowledge is scarce or expert knowledge is difficult to encode to narrow the search space 
-	No mathematical analysis is available 
-	Traditional search methods fail

In this code, all the functions required for the genetic algorithm have been designed and after they have been assembled to build the algorithm. It is not a complex code, as a simplified version of the genetic algorithm has been coded for understanding it, although it includes the different procedures of the algorithm in the different functions: 
-	Calculation of the fitness
-	Mutation 
-	Selection 
-	Reproduction + crossover

This flowchart illustrates the procedure of the genetic algorithm system:
